To get the same look as in the screenshots in the asset store, please use unitys post processing stack effect - download it via the asset store, place the effect on your camera and insert the PostProcessingProfile that comes with this pack. For best visual results, you might want to bake the scene (pretty low settings are sufficient, since the scene is pretty big).

Sorry for the inconvenience, but in the asset store, model packs aren't allowed to include any standard assets or effects.

Thanks a lot for the purchase, I hope this is useful to you!
